## Description of Challenge

Our challenge was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. I made the following changes to the html and css files:
* The title was rewritten to improve user understanding and recognition in search results.
* Semantic elements were changed in the html file to improve structure, future use and accessibility.
* Alt attributes were added to images per the Acceptance Criteria.
* CSS file was reordered for proper structure, and some portions were consolidated to remove redundancies. 

## Technologies Used

* Terminal
* GitHub
